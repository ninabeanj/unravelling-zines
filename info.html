            <h2>The Thesis</h2>
            <p><i>A brief introduction by the author...</i></p>
          </div>
          <div class="expanded-content">
            <p>This paper is a step into the world of zines and their history, while aiming to unravel the intricate details of their origins, evolution, and enduring significance. While exploring the annals of alternative publication culture, I am endeavouring to provide a succinct albeit comprehensive overview of the pertinence of zine production and dissemination. I am interested in the methods used to produce these publications, which includes analogue and digital making techniques, and also various binding techniques. Moreover, recognizing the inseparable link between zines and social and cultural movements, I contextualise their production within various historical periods, shedding light on the interplay between zine-making and broader socio-cultural dynamics. This exploration is driven by a desire to unearth the stories behind these artefacts, illuminating the intricate web of creativity, resilience, and activism that defines the world of zines. Through exploring the idea of the independent press, as well as the archiving practices of historical ephemera, my aim is to determine the relevance of zines within an institutional archive.</p>

            <h2>The Interviews</h2>
            <p><i>Some opinions from zine makers...</i></p>
          </div>
          <div class="expanded-content">
            <p>The interviews section is the heart of the digital object, providing direct access to the voices of zine makers. The interviews were conducted using a google form that was sent to participants via email, following responses on Instagram or physical interactions. The interview questions were sent out in both French and English, as most of the zinesters I have met recently are based in France, like myself. These interviews offer invaluable insights into the personal and political motivations behind zine creation, the challenges faced by zine makers, and the creative processes that drive this form of expression. By presenting these interviews in an interactive format, the digital object allows users to engage directly with the content, fostering a sense of connection and empathy with the interviewees.</p>

            <h2>The Timeline</h2>
            <p><i>A rough evolution of print...</i></p>
          </div>
          <div class="expanded-content">
            <p>The timeline section serves as a chronological guide to the evolution of zine-making tools and techniques. It highlights key developments in the history of zine production. The timeline is interactive, allowing users to hover over different techniques or tools to learn more about their significance. This feature underscores the thesisâ€™s exploration of how technological advancements have influenced zine culture, providing a visual and temporal context for the written analysis. By offering a historical perspective, the timeline helps users understand the broader technological shifts that have shaped zine-making over the years.</p>

            <h2>The Library</h2>
            <p><i>A collection of resources...</i></p>
          </div>
          <div class="expanded-content">
            <p>The library section is a curated collection of resources related to zine culture. It includes a list of the zines discussed in this thesis, links to the zine libraries previously mentioned, a suggested further reading list, a bibliography, and a manual of how to create a zine, providing users with a comprehensive toolkit for further exploration. Each resource is categorised and described, offering users a clear understanding of its relevance to the study of zine culture.<br>
The resource library extends the reach of the thesis by providing users with the means to continue their research and involvement in zine culture beyond the digital object. It serves as a bridge between the academic research presented in the thesis and the broader zine community, encouraging users to explore zine culture in greater depth.
